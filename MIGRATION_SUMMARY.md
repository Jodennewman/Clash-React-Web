# Next.js Migration Approach - Parallel Workstreams

## Migration Strategy Overview

This migration from Vite to Next.js has been divided into two parallel workstreams to maximize efficiency while minimizing conflicts. The work has been carefully separated so that each model can work independently on different aspects of the codebase.

## Completed Foundation Work

Before splitting the work, we've established a solid foundation:

- [x] Updated package.json (removed Vitest, updated project name)
- [x] Created Next.js project structure (app directory)
- [x] Created root layout.tsx with metadata 
- [x] Created page.tsx with client component wrapper
- [x] Updated tsconfig.json for Next.js
- [x] Created next.config.js
- [x] Updated vercel.json (removed SPA rewrites)

## Parallel Workstreams

### Model A: Structure & Organization (COMPLETED)

Model A focuses on the infrastructure and file organization aspects of the migration:

1. ✅ **Static File Management**: Moved static assets to the `/public` directory
2. ✅ **API Routes**: Converted Vite API handlers to Next.js API route format
3. ⏳ **Vite Cleanup**: Partial cleanup of Vite-specific configs (pending Model B completion)
4. ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Set up proper environment variables for Next.js (.env.local)
5. ✅ **Next.js Directory Structure**: Created necessary directories and placeholder files
6. ✅ **Deployment Configuration**: Updated Vercel deployment settings in vercel.json and next.config.js
7. ✅ **Documentation**: Created documentation for the migration (MIGRATION_PLAN_MODEL_A.md)

These tasks primarily involve file system operations, configuration, and server-side aspects.

### Model B: Components & Routing

Model B focuses on the React components, routing, and client-side optimizations:

1. ⏳ **GSAP Integration**: Creating a dedicated GSAP provider for Next.js
2. ⏳ **Image Utilities**: Creating utilities for Next.js Image components
3. ⏳ **Page Components**: Converting routes to Next.js page components
4. ⏳ **Navigation Updates**: Updating navigation to use Next.js Link component
5. ⏳ **Animation Fixes**: Updating GSAP animations for Next.js
6. ⏳ **Image Optimization**: Replacing standard img tags with Next.js Image components
7. ⏳ **Client-Side Code**: Fixing code that can only run on the client
8. ⏳ **Dynamic Components**: Creating dynamically imported components

These tasks primarily involve React components and client-side functionality.

## Parallelization Benefits

This parallel approach offers several benefits:

1. **Efficiency**: Work can proceed simultaneously on different aspects of the migration
2. **Reduced Conflicts**: The tasks are separated to minimize file conflicts
3. **Specialization**: Each model can focus on related tasks
4. **Faster Completion**: The overall migration can be completed more quickly

## Integration Plan

After both models complete their tasks:

1. Verify that all tasks have been completed successfully
2. Test the application to ensure it functions correctly
3. Resolve any conflicts or issues that arise
4. Complete any remaining tasks that require coordination between the two models
5. Conduct a final review and testing before deployment

## Next Steps

1. Assign the tasks to the appropriate models
2. Establish a communication channel for coordination
3. Set up a tracking mechanism for progress
4. Begin the migration work in parallel
5. Conduct regular check-ins to ensure alignment

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. The application runs successfully on Next.js
2. All features function as expected
3. Performance is maintained or improved
4. The codebase follows Next.js best practices
5. The application can be deployed to Vercel
