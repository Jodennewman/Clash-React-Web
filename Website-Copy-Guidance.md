#VS Landing Page Structure and Copy

This is what the website's copy should be as the user scrolls the page, naturally between it there will be many of the visual elements of our module and layout, but this is the core copy. The VerticalShortcutLanding.tsx needs to be re-ordered to fit with this structure and copy, and individual components will likely have to have their copy altered to fit with this story.

Components not listed below should be kept, but reference to them should be removed from VerticalShortcutLanding.tsx, including in the imports section.

##Section 1: Header, rotating headlines, big numbers, emotional

###Component: Simplehero.tsx

1 Billion+ views, zero ad spend 

The proven system to survive, thrive and monetise with short form content — specifically for founders.

And built their content from the ground up. 

Building them over 1 Billion Views in just 2 years (we told you, we’re the best)

###Component: TeamSection

So who are we?

Why trust us? 

We’re not just a guy in a room. We’re a team of creatives, who just happen to be f*cking great at making content. It’s why the number one short form agency in the world, and luckily for you we specialise in getting founders like yourself, millions of views. 

Meet the team

**Joden Newman: Founder and CEO**

Joden Clash Newman is the Founder and CEO at Clash Creation (yes Clash is literally his middle name). He started building content for founders over 3 years ago (and did very, very well). So decided to grow his own platform, reached millions of views and followers in only 3 months, and used that money to start his own company. This one.

He strongly believes that creativity, humour and intelligence is the core of all good content, and wants to use short form to educate and hire young creatives struggling in the UK’s underfunded and frankly under-appreciated creative economy.

likes: long boring films in a language that doesn’t exist (french) grindset influencers, web design — he literally made this entire website himself

dislikes: long walks on the beach, meal deals, people not buying the vertical shortcut

*“his preferred order is 20 spicy wings and a strawberry miranda”* - his local boss man

**Alex O’Connor: Co-Founder and MD**

Alex O’Connor is the Co-Founder and Managing Director at Clash Creation. He is the king of startups, with years of experience in organic marketing and management that he uses to keep us all getting paid.

Plus he’s got the gift of the gab which he uses to schmooz new clients and distract everyone in the office.

likes: networking, networthing, gut health

dislikes: ketchup, fizzy drinks and you (unless you buy the vertical shortcut)

*“he’s actually pretty sound”* - his number one opp

**Tia Warner: Strategist, Writer and Researcher**

Tia is the content strategist, writer and researcher at Clash Creation. She has a masters in AI, and uses it to criticise people who use it to write lazy copy. Her experience in newsletters make her a research and writing master. But her addiction to TikTok is probably what actually makes her good at writing short form.

likes: cooking 10/10 dinners, eating said 10/10 dinners and ‘writing’ her sci-fi book

dislikes: people asking how the book is going, people who don’t buy the vertical shortcut

*“A veritable genius”* - an anonymous source close to Tia

**Aydan Banks: Video Producer**

Aydan Banks is the Video Producer at Clash Creation. His career as a writer and producer in TV made him an expert at producing 10/10 videos. It also taught him that TV is a dying industry, and that short form is the most exciting and innovative space for young creatives to work in. He has his own successful TikTok account that focusses on high-brow political critique and low-brow comedy.

likes: stand up (when it goes well), small hats, lime bikes

dislikes: standup (when it goes badly), matt hancock, when people don’t by the vertical short cut

*“he knows all the secrets of the london underground”* - a high level TV exec (did you know he used to work in TV)

##Section 6: Pain Points (vertical style)

###Component: VSPainPoints

You’re bored of failing content.

At this point you’ve sunk years of your life, millions of pounds and an army of creative freelancers into the dream of working out the “algorithm”. And all it’s done is reward your optimism and naivety with a slew of 200 view videos, and comments from russian bots.

You’re bleeding money into Meta’s money-pit.

Without an organic strategy that works, you’re relying entirely on paid ads which get marginal views on instagram (because genZ HATE feeling like they’re being sold to) or pretty decent views on facebook — but that’s completely useless unless boomers are your dream clientele.

Your social team is stressed (and so are you).

Whether your team are top level marketers or graduates with a point to prove, nailing short form content is a very niche skill and there isn’t much education on how to do it right. You’re frustrated at the results and your team has no idea what to do.

You want more inbound leads.

You’ve got the product, the business, the vision. But your dream clients don’t even know you exist. You’re craving inbound leads, and a full inbox of DMs from people who **already** see you as the ****authority in your space.

If that’s you, we’ve got the solution.

##Section 9: The Course Curriculum

###Component: CourseViewer

Is making actually good short form content really that complex? 

Well yes and no. It’s simple, but there’s a lot to it. 

The Course Curriculum

[Module HUD]

##Section 10: Week by week structure

###Component: CourseTimeline

We know it’s a lot. 

That’s why we’ve broken it down into 8 weeks of structured learning to take you from short form newbie, to millions of views, in just 8 weeks. 

Week 0: For the Nerds.
Once your application has gone though you’ll have immediate access to our first week of content: that’s the basic theory plus all three upskiller sections for your team, AND immediate access to our exclusive founder community. 

We’d recommend you start watching the content as soon as you get access (or getting your team to watch it and summarise it), so you can feel smarter than everyone else in the first group call. 

Week 1: Theory. 

At the end of this week you’ll be exhausted, but your brain will probably be 50% bigger. You’ll have the basic theory down, the dos and don’ts of short form, how to actually ‘hack’ the algorithm. Plus all the knowledge to write a good hook, a good script, feel good on camera, AND you’ll come away with a unique content strategy personalised to you ready to start posting immediately. We did say it’s a lot.

PLUS. Your team will have access to everything they need in the upskillers to start mastering researching, scripting, filming and editing.

At the end of this week we’ll have our first group call, with the other founders in the community. This week we’ll focus on introductions, getting to know each other, and help on refining your content strategy. Plus answering the many questions I’m sure you’ll have.

Week 2: Authority. 
It’s all well and good making good short form content. But you want more than that - you want to be an authority. At the end of this week you’ll know all there is to know about building authority on short form, at all levels, specifically as a founder. You’ll learn how to build authority into your strategy, embed it into your content, and engage with your audience. 

The group coaching call at the end of this week will focus on how to tailor this authority to your specific niche, business, and personality. 

Week 3: Advanced Theory. 

Time to take it up a notch. All that theory you’ve spent weeks learning? There’s even more. At the end of this week you’ll know all the advanced techniques we use for hooking, engagement, storytelling and iteration, to build the best content possible. Plus we’ll finally address the founder paradox you’ll definitely be running into…

The call at the end of this week will focus on putting all of this theory into practice with a group workshop. 

Week 4: Reading week.

The first few weeks may be heavy, and we know you’re busy, so take this week as a breather. You can use it to catch up on theory you may have missed, start practicing everything you’ve learnt so far with your team, or just go on holiday.

But if you do go on holiday, make sure to log on for the group call at the end of the week (no rest for us). This one will be an open Q&A and we promise no question is off the table (no matter how stupid) so everyone feels up to date and confident in the content so far. 

Week 5: Delegation. 

Maybe your team had a nice break last week. Maybe not. Either way it’s now time to give them more work. At the end of week 5 you’ll know exactly how to manage your creative team, and turn them into the efficient in-house content machine you’ve always dreamed of. 

The week 5 group call will focus on how to efficiently get your team to execute your vision, and create content that represents you, with minimal founder time and input. 

Week 6: Monetisation (Everyone’s favourite). 

Views are great. But we all know why you’re really doing this course. At the end of this week you’ll know everything we know (so everything there is to know) on lead mags, CTAs, the creator fund, speaking engagements and sponsorship deals. 

The call at the end of this week will be focussed on which monetisation option is best for you.

Week 7: Conversion. 

By week 7, the views will be coming in, and now it’s time to convert them into paying customers or leads. After watching this week’s modules you’ll learn about every type of short-form funnel, whether its direct to your website, your lead magnet, or another platform. And how to make people actually click on it. 

This group call will be our last one on course content (congrats you’ve made it this far) and will centre around the best conversion strategy for your business. 

Week 8: Darks Arts. 

We’ve taught you everything we know. Now it’s time to put it all into practice. Be brave and try it out yourself this week, no hand holding…

…Well a bit of hand holding. This week’s call will be an open Q&A where we’ll troubleshoot, advice and analyse everything you’ve been through in your first week out in the wild. 

Week 9-10: I thought this was only an 8 week course? 

Yes. But we assume you’ll still want some help. So in this two week period you and/or your team can book in a personalised 45 minute call with any one of our experts you desire. We’ll help in any way we can to get your content up and running smoothly. 

Week 10+: It’s time to fly the nest.
But don’t forgot you’ll continue to have lifetime access to all the course resources and videos. Plus whether you’re looking for advice (or just wanting a chat) you’ll still have direct communication with the founder community and our team of experts. We’re not going anywhere. Also i’m in love with you.

Section 12: The Founders Track

Component: FounderTrack

The Founders Track

Built exactly for founders. 

Im sure at this point you’re mindful of your time and how much of it this course will take (especially if you’ve actually read all of this copy). Which is why we’ve built the Vertical Shortcut with the founders track in mind. 
Basically, the Founder’s Track is an easy way to scan the course for the modules you actually **have** to watch, and the modules you can pass onto your team. 

##Section 13: The Team Track

###Component: TabsLeft

The Team Tracks

And of course, we’re mindful of your team’s time too. So we’ve created a writer, producer and editor track for each of them too. 

And if you’ve just got one content guy, then he’s just going to have to watch all of them.

##Section 17: FAQs 

###Component: FAQ

FAQs

And frequently given answers

**Why is short form a good investment?**

- Answer
    
    Short form content has only really been around since 2020. But in that short space of time it has grown an insane amount. 62.6% of the global population is currently on social media, that’s well over 5 billion people, and each of them spends around 2 and a half hours on there. Every single day. 5 billion people watching for 2 and a half hours. Short form is where the attention is and it’s where people are buying. Studies show that 96% of all consumers prefer video over text when learning about a product or a service, and 73% of those consumers prefer to learn about it through short form video specifically. 
    
    So if you have a product - and that product could be you - short form is the only reasonable place to start dominating. Especially if you’re trying to target gen z. 70% of them watch short form videos every single day, this is the place to reach them. 
    

**Who is this course designed for?**

- Answer
    
    This course is for founders and creative team members who are ready to transform their approach to short form over an 8-week period. Our clients include agency founders, CMOs, MDs, experts and straight up growth hackers. So, if you want to understand how to get views on short form, this course is for you.
    

**How is the course structured?**

- Answer
    
    Well you *should* read the course structure. But here’s the top line:
    8 weeks of pre-recorded content, live sessions, workshops and PDFs. Lifetime access to all our resources, plus our founder community and our team of experts. 
    

**What topics does the course cover?**

- Answer
    
    Our course covers everything. And we mean everything. From the fundamentals of starting your account, to what makes a good video (and a bad one). And all the tools and theory you need to make videos that algorithms ‘aka audiences’ love. Plus how to get this all up and running with a content team that runs itself. And then make money and leads from it. 
    

**How much time should I commit weekly?**

- Answer
    
    
    We know how busy you are, so outside of the hour weekly sessions, the course is designed to be completely flexible. Ideally, you and/or your team dedicate 3-4 hours per week to maximise value from the weekly sessions.
    If you’re a very time-strapped founder, please check out the founder and team tracks to know which modules you need to watch, and which ones to hand over to them. 
    

**How quickly will I see results?**

- Answer
    
    Despite our glowing results, short form is a tricky beast, and requires commitment. If you use the contact time right, apply yourself fully and trust the process, we’d expect you’ll do great.
    Founders that work with us tend to see an initial warming up period, then a steady, consistent increase in views over the first 3 months.
    

**What happens when I sign up?**

- Answer
    
    Once you’ve applied, and you’re all signed off and ready to go, you’ll be given immediate access to the first week of content (we don’t want to overwhelm you) plus a group chat directly in contact with us, and the other lucky founders in your cohort.

#still to do

1 make sure ConvertKit and Kajabi APIs are set up correctly with the page tracking data & email capture on the qualification modal. Make sure the result of the quiz is passed onto both CRMs. Make sure scroll depth tracking and viewer engagement tracking functionality is properly working.

2 On build and upload, the site can only be entered at it's route (clashcreation.com) going directly to any other route (/landing /questions /contact anything like that) – EVEN WHEN THE RROUTE EXISTS, results in a 404 error.

3 Website efficiency needs to be improved, like setting the video embed to 'display none' when the user is a certain scroll depth away

4 when website page loads, oftentimes the scroll jumps to slightly down the page – will need to make sure that when the page is loaded in that the scroll is always started at the top of the screen

5 components missing from the website copy above need to be created

6 proper integration of course utils needs to be functioning accross the board, especially in the stats section, but in any section that mentions anything about the course titles, amount of modules, amount of submodules (which should be renamed 'lessons' when referenced in website copy'). Currently this functionality either doesn't work, or is not properly implemented'

7 need to learn how to put images and course-data.json into the dist build, so all is readily available.

8 Website needs to follow all regular standards, whatever they may be.

9 Accecibility best practices to be added (without breaking code)

10 SEO Optimisation needs to occur.

11 several components designs need to be further perfected

12 more to come I'm sure'
