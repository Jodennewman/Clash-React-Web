 - name: Course Utils and Data Access
      rule: |
        Follow these patterns when working with course data:
        - Use the centralized course-utils.ts for all data access
        - Access course data through utility functions rather than direct 
  imports
        - All data should be dynamically calculated from course-data.json
        - Implement proper caching with Maps for expensive operations
        - Utilize the hierarchy of courseData → categories → sections → 
  modules → submodules
        - Use getThumbnailPath, getAvatarPath, getSubmoduleThumbnail, and 
  getModuleThumbnail for image references
        - Check for null data at every step with optional chaining
        - Use courseStats for dynamic course statistics (totalModules, 
  totalHours, etc.)
