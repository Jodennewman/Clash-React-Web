        Implement robust error handling and performance optimizations:
        - Always check for null/undefined with optional chaining
        - Implement proper error boundaries for component-level error 
  handling
        - Use memoization via useMemo and useCallback for expensive 
  operations
        - Implement browser and device detection for optimal experiences
        - Follow the progressive enhancement strategy for all features
        - Keep performance in mind, especially for mobile devices
        - Ensure proper cleanup for event listeners, animations, and 
  effects
        - Use lazy loading for components and assets where appropriate
        - Always verify implementations on both mobile and desktop
