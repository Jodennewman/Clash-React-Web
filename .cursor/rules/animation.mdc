        For GSAP animations, follow these critical patterns:
        - Always use useGSAP hook or useLayoutEffect with proper cleanup
        - Create a gsap.context() for every animation block
        - Return a cleanup function that calls context.revert()
        - For ScrollTrigger, always include unique ID for debugging
        - Always check for refs before initializing animations
        - Optimize for mobile devices with conditional animations
        - Register animations in globalAnimations for proper cleanup
        - Use AnimationController to centralize animation management
        - Implement device detection for conditional animation loading
