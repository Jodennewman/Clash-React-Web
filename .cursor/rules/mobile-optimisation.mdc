        Follow these patterns for mobile-responsive implementations:
        - Use the useDeviceDetection() hook for consistent device detection
        - Implement conditional animations for mobile devices:
          - Simplify or disable complex animations on mobile
          - Use ScrollTrigger's "once: true" parameter for mobile 
  animations
          - Reduce animation complexity on mobile (fewer keyframes, less 
  motion)
        - Fix layout issues with proper mobile-first responsive design:
          - Start with mobile layouts using Tailwind's mobile-first 
  approach
          - Use proper container-mobile classes with correct padding
          - Never create elements that extend beyond viewport width
        - Optimize performance on mobile:
          - Reduce JS execution by conditionally loading animations
          - Simplify GSAP animations for mobile devices
          - Ensure smooth scrolling with optimized ScrollSmoother settings
        - Implement proper touch targets (minimum 44px Ã— 44px for 
  interactive elements)
        - Test all implementations on actual mobile devices
