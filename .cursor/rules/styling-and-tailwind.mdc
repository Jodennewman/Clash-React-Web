        This project uses Tailwind v4 with a custom theme system:
        - Use class="bg-[var(--theme-bg-primary)]" for theme-aware 
  variables
        - Never use direct color values, always reference theme variables
        - Use utility classes for consistent implementation
        - Implement mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind 
  breakpoints
        - Follow the VS brand style guide with proper gradients, animations
        - No plain white backgrounds - always use subtle gradients
        - Implement floating elements correctly for both light and dark 
  mode
        - Use VS utility classes like hover-bubbly for consistent effects
        - Follow the 80% professional structure / 20% creative energy
