# High-Ticket Product Qualification Strategy

## Strategic Overview

This document summarizes an implementation strategy for a high-ticket (£5,000+) educational product using a qualification-based approach that presents multiple pricing tiers as a "spectrum of implementation" rather than rigid packages.

## Key Approaches

### Solution Spectrum Approach
- Present a single comprehensive core offering upfront
- Use qualification data to reveal the most appropriate implementation approach
- Position pricing differences as implementation methods, not product tiers

### Progressive Qualification
- Use 4-5 strategic questions to determine client needs
- Score responses to recommend the appropriate implementation path
- Combine with engagement data for more accurate recommendations

### Three-Tier Implementation Structure
1. **Foundation Implementation** (£1-2k)
   - Self-directed with minimal hands-on support
   - Core educational materials only
   - Limited team access

2. **Comprehensive Implementation** (£5k - primary offering)
   - Guided implementation with regular support
   - Full cohort experience with live streams
   - Complete team training system

3. **Executive Partnership** (£9-10k)
   - White-glove implementation with dedicated support
   - Customization of turnkey systems
   - Extended support timeline

## Qualification Flow
1. Visitor engages with landing page (engagement tracked)
2. Takes "Implementation Strategy" assessment (not presented as qualification)
3. Questions focus on needs, not budget:
   - Team structure
   - Implementation support preference
   - Timeline
   - Content volume goals
4. Algorithm combines answers and engagement data
5. Personalized recommendation presented
6. Direct path to Calendly booking with prefilled data

## Technical Implementation
- First-party data tracking (no cross-site cookies)
- React components for qualification journey
- Calendly integration with data prefilling
- Email automation for abandoned journeys
- CRM integration for lead scoring

## Landing Page Strategy
- Focus on comprehensive core offering
- Detailed feature explanation
- Implementation flexibility as customization option
- Single primary CTA: "Find Your Implementation Strategy"

## Benefits
- Maintains premium positioning
- Leverages psychology of tiered pricing
- Focuses qualification on needs, not budget
- Creates personalized experience
- Improves lead quality for sales calls
