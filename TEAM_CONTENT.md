## Joden Newman
**Title:** Founder and CEO

**Bio:** Joden Clash Newman is the Founder and CEO at Clash Creation (yes Clash is literally his middle name). He started building content for founders over 3 years ago (and did very, very well). So decided to grow his own platform, reached millions of views and followers in only 3 months, and used that money to start his own company. This one. He strongly believes that creativity, humour and intelligence is the core of all good content, and wants to use short form to educate and hire young creatives struggling in the UK's underfunded and frankly under-appreciated creative economy.

**Likes:**
- Long boring films in a language that doesn't exist (french)
- Grindset influencers
- Web design â€” he literally made this entire website himself

**Dislikes:**
- Long walks on the beach
- Meal deals
- People not buying the vertical shortcut

**Quote:** "his preferred order is 20 spicy wings and a strawberry miranda"
**Quote Author:** his local boss man

## Alex O'Connor
**Title:** Co-Founder and MD

**Bio:** Alex O'Connor is the Co-Founder and Managing Director at Clash Creation.

## Tia Warner
**Title:** Strategist, Writer and Researcher

**Bio:** Tia is the content strategist, writer and researcher at Clash Creation. She has a masters in AI, and uses it to criticise people who use it to write lazy copy. Her experience in newsletters make her a research and writing master. But her addiction to TikTok is probably what actually makes her good at writing short form.

**Likes:**
- Cooking 10/10 dinners
- Eating said 10/10 dinners
- 'Writing' her sci-fi book

**Dislikes:**
- People asking how the book is going
- People who don't buy the vertical shortcut

## Aydan Banks
**Title:** Video Producer

**Bio:** Aydan Banks is the Video Producer at Clash Creation. His career as a writer and producer in TV made him an expert at producing 10/10 videos. It also taught him that TV is a dying industry, and that short form is the most exciting and innovative space for young creatives to work in. He has his own successful TikTok account that focusses on high-brow political critique and low-brow comedy.

**Likes:**
- Stand up (when it goes well)
- Small hats
- Lime bikes

**Dislikes:**
- Standup (when it goes badly)
- Matt hancock
- When people don't buy the vertical shortcut
