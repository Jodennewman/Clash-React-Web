# Model A Migration Tasks Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Static Files Management
- ✅ Created public/assets directory
- ✅ Copied assets from src/assets to public/assets

### 2. API Routes Conversion
- ✅ Created app/api/crm-integration directory
- ✅ Created route.ts with Next.js API route handler
- ✅ Converted Vite API handler to Next.js format

### 3. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created .env.local file
- ✅ Converted Vite environment variables to Next.js format (VITE_* → NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
- ✅ Added server-side environment variables (non-public)

### 4. Directory Structure Setup
- ✅ Validated app directory structure
- ✅ Ensured compatibility with existing src directory until full migration is complete

### 5. Vite Cleanup
- ✅ Updated next.config.js for Next.js compatibility
- ⬜ Remove Vite-specific dependencies (Pending Model B completion)
- ⬜ Clean up Vite-specific configuration files (Pending Model B completion)

### 6. Deployment Configuration 
- ✅ Updated vercel.json for Next.js deployment
- ✅ Added build command and framework specification
- ✅ Preserved existing headers and image configuration

## Next Steps
1. Coordinate with Model B team for completion of Components & Routing tasks
2. Complete Vite cleanup after all components are migrated
3. Remove duplicate files and configurations once migration is stable
4. Test deployment to ensure everything is working correctly

## Known Issues
- Path aliasing needs to be tested to ensure @/ imports work correctly
- Static asset references will need to be updated after Model B completes image component migration
