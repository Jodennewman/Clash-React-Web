## Summary of Deliverables

1. **Core Components**:
   - GSAPProvider and animation utilities
   - NextImage optimized components
   - Next.js compatible layout and navigation
   - Client-side utilities for browser APIs

2. **Page Routes**:
   - All routes from router.tsx implemented as Next.js pages
   - Custom 404 page
   - Dynamic component loading with fallbacks

3. **Animation System**:
   - Reusable animation components
   - Animation presets library
   - GSAP integration with Next.js

4. **Migration Patterns**:
   - Safe browser API usage
   - Next.js routing instead of React Router
   - Dynamic imports with Suspense
   - Safe image optimization

## Next Steps for Integration

1. Test all implemented changes in a Next.js environment
2. Coordinate with Model A team for integration of server components
3. Ensure all static assets are properly referenced
4. Test deployment configuration
5. Verify all components render correctly in Next.js
6. Conduct performance testing to ensure optimizations work as expected
