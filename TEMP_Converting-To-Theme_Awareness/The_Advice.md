Let me complete the inline style converter tool and provide a comprehensive approach to implement the theme-aware variable system throughout your codebase:

After analyzing your codebase and CSS structure in detail, I've created a comprehensive set of tools and guidelines to help you transition to the theme-aware approach. Here's my implementation plan:

## 1. Understanding the Problem

Your current implementation has a common issue when dealing with light/dark mode:

- You're using **competing styles** (e.g., `bg-[var(--secondary-teal)] dark:bg-[var(--secondary-teal-light)]`) which creates maintenance challenges
- Inline styles with CSS variables don't automatically adapt to theme changes
- There's duplication when defining styles for both light and dark modes

## 2. The Theme-Aware Solution

The key solution is to use single CSS variables that automatically update their values based on the current theme:

1. **Theme-Aware Variables**: Add variables like `--theme-text-primary` that map to different values in light/dark mode
2. **Utility Classes**: Create utility classes like `text-theme-primary` that use these variables
3. **Conversion Tools**: Use the provided tools to scan and convert your codebase

## 3. Implementation Tools

I've created several tools to help you implement this approach:

1. **Theme-Aware CSS Variables**: A comprehensive set of theme-aware variables to add to your globals.css
2. **Theme-Aware Variable Converter**: A script to scan your codebase for issues and suggest replacements
3. **Component Style Converter**: A tool to automatically convert component styles to the theme-aware approach
4. **Inline Style Converter**: A utility to convert inline styles to theme-aware classes
5. **Variable Search and Replace Tool**: A tool to find and replace all instances of CSS variables

## 4. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

The "Theme-Aware Implementation Guide" artifact provides a comprehensive step-by-step approach:

1. **Add Theme Variables**: Add the theme-aware variables to your globals.css
2. **Run Conversion Tools**: Use the provided JavaScript tools to find and replace problematic styles
3. **Manual Review**: Check components that need special attention
4. **Implement Floating Elements**: Add theme-aware floating elements
5. **Update Animations**: Make animations theme-aware
6. **Test Both Modes**: Verify everything works in both light and dark themes

## 5. Example Conversions

Here are the key types of conversions you'll make:

### From competing styles:
```jsx
<div className="bg-[var(--secondary-teal)] dark:bg-[var(--secondary-teal-light)]">
```

### To theme-aware approach:
```jsx
<div className="bg-[var(--theme-accent-secondary)]">
```

### From inline styles:
```jsx
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-cream)' }}>
```

### To theme-aware classes:
```jsx
<div className="bg-[var(--theme-bg-primary)]">
```

## Next Steps

1. First, add the theme-aware variables from the "Theme-Aware CSS Variables to Add" artifact to your globals.css
2. Run the conversion tools to identify issues in your codebase
3. Follow the implementation guide to systematically update your components
4. Test thoroughly in both light and dark modes

Would you like me to modify any of these tools for your specific needs, or would you like more examples of how to convert particular components in your codebase?
