### HUD Layout Structure and Section Mapping

The ModuleHUD follows this specific layout pattern with sections mapped to the following course areas:

1. **First BigSquare**: Basic Theory / Core Concepts
   - This is the foundational learning material (ID: "basic_theory")
   
2. **Column of 3 Squares**: Three Upskillers
   - Research & Writing (ID: "upskiller_authentic_research_writer")
   - Shooting (ID: "upskiller_shorts_ready_videographer")
   - Editing (ID: "upskiller_vertical_video_editors")
   
3. **Column of 2 Squares**: PR/Authority & Delegation
   - PR & Authority (ID: "pr_authority")
   - Delegation (ID: "delegation")
   
4. **Second BigSquare**: Advanced Theory / Core Concepts Mastery
   - This is the advanced theoretical material (ID: "advanced_theory")
   
5. **Third Column**: Business Scaling
   - Delegation (ID: "delegation")
   - Monetisation (ID: "monetisation")
   - Conversion (ID: "conversion")
   
6. **Third BigSquare**: System & Products
   - This represents the complete frameworks/systems (ID: "delegation" or could be visually represented as 3 small squares for different product aspects)

### Utility Scripts

Two validation scripts have been added to confirm data structure compatibility:

1. **test-course-data.js**
   - Validates that module and submodule data has all required fields for the modal
   - Tests compatibility of section IDs with course-data.json
   - Helps identify mismatches between component expectations and actual data

2. **list-sections.js**
   - Lists all categories and sections from course-data.json
   - Provides a clear overview of available sections and their IDs
   - Helps with mapping section IDs to the correct visual elements

These scripts enable verification without running the dev server, ensuring data compatibility.

### Special Implementation Notes

#### Duplicate Section ID Handling

The Delegation section (ID: "delegation") appears in multiple UI contexts:
1. As "Delegation" in the second column
2. As "Team Building" in the third column 
3. As "Systems & Products" for the third BigSquare

To handle this, we implemented a `displayKey` property to differentiate these occurrences:
```jsx
{
  id: "delegation",
  name: "Delegation",
  displayKey: 'delegation-col2'
},
{
  id: "delegation",
  name: "Team Building",  
  displayKey: 'delegation-col3'
},
{
  id: "delegation",
  name: "Systems & Products",
  displayKey: 'delegation-systems'
}
```

This allows multiple visual representations while still connecting to the correct course data.

## Design Specifications

### 1. Base Design Elements
- Background color: Warm cream (#FDF7E4)
- Section-block cards: Rounded squares (1rem radius) with subtle drop shadows
- Color coding: Each module type uses a different brand color from our palette
- Typography: Clean, neeue haas grotesk as per style guide, with clear hierarchy

### 2. minimalist layout:

Bigsquare(double scale) ||| column of 3 squares ||| column of 2 squares ||| Bigsquare(double scale) ||| column of 2 squares ||| BigSquare (or tri-square, or rotating 3d cube, or square with smoke coming out, or square with metal texture, or 3 squares with different robotic desingn features)

The last square design will have to connote the 3 parts of the 'product/turn key system' as it will be more an actual resource than a educational or training product

Gaps between squares are 
    horizontally:(normal square width)*1.5
    vertically: (normal square width)*1
    
when it comes to responsive design, there will have to be a dynamic approach to this. For tablet and mobile breakpoints this should be having the layout rotate 90 degrees – although to avoid rotation complications, this would be better expressed through flex direction changes (the outer l-r row becomes a t-b column && the tinner t-b column  becomes a l-r row)

Modules marked 'featured:true' in the database will have a small red circle (overflow: visible) centred on their top right corner, to mimic the notification ui viewers are likely to be familar with through mobile app notifications.


### 3. Expansion Animation
- On click, a section-block smoothly expands to reveal content.
- A square will expand depending on the amount of module-blocks it needs to display.
- For example, if it has 7 modules, then it will expand to the size of a 9x9 grid of squares – if it has 11 modules it will expand to the size of 4x4 squares, with squares inside scaled in a fashion that still fills the square, so some larger or more important modules can be expanded in width/height to fill the square (duration and 'featured modules' are both flagged in the database and can be used to determine this).
- Animation should use GSAP for smooth transitions (0.3-0.4s duration with a 'bounce back' type of ease).
- Expanded section-block should push other content away rather than overlay ( if there is chance of overlap)
- when a module-block is then clicked, A Modal will pop-up with the module content structure

### 4. Module Content Structure
- Module thumbnail at the top
- Module title overlaying the base of the thumbnail (18-24px, bold)
- Brief description (14-16px, regular weight)
- Three bulletpoints on what's inside
- List of the module's component sub-modules with small icons down the left hand menu.
- Visual indicators for "must-watch" or "founder essential" content
- on click of a submodule, some more details about it appear, possibly as a tooltip, possibly in another section of the modal. When a decision is made here, update this.

### 5. Interactive Elements
- Hover effects: Subtle scale (1.02-1.05x) and shadow increase (as per website design guide)
- Click anywhere on module card to expand/collapse
- Filter tabs at top to show specific module categories (not priority)

### Implementation Note
- Focus only on the rig in the center of the screen. All data will be based off of the course-data.json file. The interface must function in this minimalist way, with featured modules having a red circle indicator. There are two very big sections in the course: Core Theory and Core Mastery.
- it may be most wise to have the certain parts of the data from the course, especiallly those that effect layout, parsed first, and hardcoded into another temp database or .env file that has the variables for the layout in it. This would only then update once whenever course-data.json is changed. This would hopefully reduce page load times.

## Course Structure
Below is only for example and understanding, all actual data here must be provided through course-data.json parsing, or a fluid .env file as suggested above. Below is subject to change and does not contain the copy or the submodules, so should not be hardcoded.
