## Design Specifications

### 1. Base Design Elements
- Background color: Warm cream (#FDF7E4)
- Module cards: Rounded rectangles (12px radius) with subtle drop shadows
- Color coding: Each module type uses a different brand color from our palette
- Typography: Clean, sans-serif with clear hierarchy

### 2. Module Grid Layout
- Start with a grid of collapsed modules (colorful squares/rectangles)
- Varying sizes to create visual hierarchy (main sections larger than sub-modules)
- Comfortable spacing between elements (20-30px minimum)
- Responsive design that maintains layout integrity across screen sizes

### 3. Expansion Animation
- On click, a module smoothly expands to reveal content
- Animation should use GSAP for smooth transitions (0.3-0.4s duration)
- Expanded module should push other content away rather than overlay
- Add subtle fade-in for text content inside expanded modules

### 4. Module Content Structure
- Module title at top (18-24px, bold)
- Brief description (14-16px, regular weight)
- List of sub-modules or lessons with small icons
- Visual indicators for "must-watch" or "founder essential" content

### 5. Interactive Elements
- Hover effects: Subtle scale (1.02-1.05x) and shadow increase
- Click anywhere on module card to expand/collapse
- Progress indicators for completed modules (small circular progress)
- Filter tabs at top to show specific module categories

### Implementation Note
Focus only on the rig in the center of the screen. All data will be based off of the course-data.json file. The interface must function in this minimalist way, with featured modules having a red circle indicator. There are two very big sections in the course: Core Theory and Core Mastery.

## Course Structure
Each module will be split into 2-6 submodules.

### Section 1: Basic Theory
1. Intro: Big picture on short form (Founder specific)
2. Algorithmic Understanding
3. 3 cardinal sins and cardinal virtues
