## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Consistent Structure

All stages follow the same structure:
- Header section with title
- Content section with hover effect
- Supporting text below with increased tracking

### 2. Interactive Elements

- Hover states for content sections (increased opacity, subtle border changes)
- Smooth transitions (duration-300)
- Cursor-pointer indicators for interactive elements
- Clear selection states for options

### 3. Typography

- Differentiated title sizing:
  - Intro and team size stage titles: text-sm font-medium (smaller size)
  - Other stage titles: text-base sm:text-lg font-medium (larger for remaining stages)
- Top section text removed from team size stage for cleaner look
- Content headers: text-base md:text-lg font-medium
- Supporting text: text-xl md:text-2xl tracking-wide
- Option text: Consistently sized and spaced

### 4. Spacing

- Consistent padding: p-5 md:p-6
- Consistent spacing between elements: space-y-4
- Consistent margins: mb-2, mb-3, mb-4

## UI Improvements

1. **Simplified Visual Design**
   - Removal of excessive visual elements
   - Focus on content and interaction
   - Consistent color usage through theme variables

2. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Improved mobile layout
   - Consistent grid systems (1-column on mobile, multi-column on desktop)
   - Proper text sizing at all breakpoints

3. **Enhanced Usability**
   - Clear interactive indicators
   - Better form validation feedback
   - Improved button layouts
   - Manual progression with Continue button (no auto-advance)

4. **Theming and Accessibility**
   - Theme-aware styling throughout
   - Proper contrast ratios
   - Careful semantic HTML structure

## Access and Testing

The new qualification modal can be accessed at:
- `/tia-qualification` route in the application

## Future Considerations

1. **Animation Refinement**
   - Consider adding subtle entrance/exit animations for stages
   - Enhance the selection animation for better feedback

2. **Analytics Integration**
   - The modal is prepared with event tracking hooks
   - Further integration with actual analytics system needed

3. **A/B Testing**
   - The new design is ready for comparison testing with the original
   - Tracking conversion rates between the two designs would be valuable
